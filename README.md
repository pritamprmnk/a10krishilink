Five bullet points to feature my website :
(i).A social agro networking platform where farmers, traders, and consumers can connect, share crop posts, and collaborate directly without a traditional e-commerce system.

(ii). Users can post, browse, and manage agricultural items, with advanced search, detailed crop information, and interest submission features.

(iii).Secure authentication system including email/password & Google login, with fully protected private routes and responsive UI.

(iv).Interest-based interaction system where buyers can send requests, and crop owners can accept/reject interests with real-time updates.

(v).Modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface, built with a clean design, dynamic sections, and seamless navigation across all devices.
